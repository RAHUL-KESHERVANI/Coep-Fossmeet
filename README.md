FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software. The word ‘free’ implies freedom to modify, copy and redistribute the source code so that others could benefit from it as well. Due to this constant improvement , FOSS has fewer bugs and becomes more reliable and secure than most proprietary softwares (like Windows). Though it may seem that FOSS caters only to programmers/geeks, there are many open source softwares meant for general public. Some strong examples to this claim are Firefox, Wordpress, Android and so on.
